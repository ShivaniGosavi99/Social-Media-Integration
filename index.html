			<p>This saying means that we should help our family first. The others will come afterwards. A child learns to share his things with his brothers and sisters in the family. He who lives for himself and does not care for the members of his family and others can’t be called a good person. He who has not learnt to sacrifice his interests for the sake of others can’t be called a good citizen. He is regarded as a selfish person. The lesson of charity begins at home. The child learns the lesson of sacrifice, cooperation and affection in the family.</p>
